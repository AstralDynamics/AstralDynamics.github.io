Early in November the team arrived in India. Having finalised things with our spin-out Elidir Health Ltd, we decided it was time for us to take to the high seas in search of a new adventure.

India today is a very exciting continent to be on, especially in the world of tech. Already I'm amazed at how much of the population has a smart phone. When you consider that someone who earns a few dollars a day can be a user of your app, then if you can innovate something which add $1 of value to a user ,then your already having a significant impact on your users lives.

With this in mind we are currently exploring the continent, networking with people here, looking for new ideas to work on and developing our own. We plan to start up in India in the next 6 months and show what we can do.
