After spinning out our [first company][1], we decided that rather than returning to routine, we'd pack our bags and head for Asia to spend the winter travelling, working and exploring together. I've just arrived back in the UK after a fantastic four months on the road and it's time to write up some of the experiences.

We're know that we're blessed to be part of an industry where our entire business can come with us in a rucksack and we can set up to work just about anywhere with a 3G internet connection. We made plans by night on sleeper trains, we developed apps by the warmth of log burners in wooden Himalayan villages, we took video calls with clients by the sides of glacial rivers, we hiked, we swam, we explored and we worked.

But taking this kind of step away from day-to-day life needs more than just the blessings of the industry, it requires a sense of adventure and a team that are motivated and excited enough to make it happen.

We set off for India on November 3rd, 2015.

## India
Whether it was waking up to the tranquility of winter in the Himalayas, or choking on the smog over Delhi, or being deafened by firecrackers and small explosives, whilst celebrating Diwali with a local family, or just freezing my balls off, stripping down and climbing into a hotspring; my first experience of India left my senses exhausted, but in a good way.

We started in Delhi and travelled by sleeper train into Rajasthan, where we stayed with [Rishabh's][5] family for Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. Between observing religious ceremonies, we filled up on home cooked Indian food, explored the city's ancient fort, adventured through the markets, between the stray cows and baffled locals and got set up for working over 3G for the rest of the time in India.

From there, we made our way north for the long journey from Chandigarh into the Himalayas.

As someone who has always lived among mountains, I've always wondered about the Himalayas, so it was great to finally get there and see them. We travelled to the end of the road in Parvati valley, then hiked to the nearest village, where we set up camp for the next couple of weeks.

From there, we worked on some contracts from the UK and used our village as a base for exploring some of the other local villages and settlements. The lack of a road means that anything the wooden shops and cafes want to sell, must arrive by pony supply lines and everywhere you go, you'll find the Himachali people, coaxing huge lines of burdened ponies or cows along the rocky paths.

It's a fascinating country, but we only arrived there with 30 day E-Tourist Visas, so with time against us, we went back to Delhi, before travelling south to Bangalore and eventually Chennai. From there we made for the airport and flew the short distance to Sri Lanka, with plans to apply for full Indian visas.

## Sri Lanka
After a month in India, the fresh green jungle, daily torrential rainfall and the abundance of fresh fruit and black tea were a welcome relief in Sri Lanka. The food is delicious, the people are friendly and things move just a bit slower than their Indian counterparts.

We made our way to Dambulla, where we settled to catch up on work and spent our days enjoying fresh papaya, mango and bananas whilst we sheltered from the rain and worked on some client websites. One afternoon we even tried to canoe out to an island of the nearby reservoir, but the Sri Lankan lake police decided they weren't having any of it and whistled us back in.

Eventually, we left Kandalama in the back of a potato cart and bumped along the dirt track roads, then caught the next bus heading north, switched onto a train and found ourselves in city of Jaffna. I spent most of the time there [taking part in the triannual Ludum Dare competition][4]. Unfortunately, I wasn't quite busy enough that I didn't get chased barefoot out of the empty city centre by some scary looking wild dogs, whilst wishing I'd had that rabies jab.

Within a week we'd made our way down to the southern coast and explored the miles of deserted red sand beaches in Hambantota, before heading to the capital city of Colombo, where I cancelled my flight and renewed my Sri Lankan visa, before saying goodbye to the others and heading to Hikkaduwa for Christmas on the beach.

After a few weeks of surfing, swimming and snorkelling on the gorgeous south coast, my girlfriend decided to come and visit, so I travelled back to Negombo to meet her. We spent some more time in the mountains, exploring the tea plantations, strawberry farms and waterfalls, before returning to the south coast to eat barbecued seafood on the beach and spend time with some friends I made on my first trip around.

By this point, the rest of the team was back in India. Liam went back to Bangalore to network in the thriving tech scene, whilst Rishabh travelled back to Delhi to finish laying the groundwork for starting an Indian company to partner with Astral Dynamics. They have their own stories and I'm sure we'll hear them in a blog post soon enough.

The end of my doubled Sri Lankan visa came around too soon and I still hadn't applied to return to India, so instead we hopped on a plane and flew over the Bay of Bengal to spend a month in Thailand.

## Thailand
I've been intrigued by the descriptions of Thailand's buzzing culture, carefree lifestyle and deserted islands. Since I set off for India, it had always been in the back of my mind as the logical next destination.

Bangkok is the definition of an exciting city. Whether we were eating scorpions on the infamous Khao San Road, riding the skytrain, mistaking monitor lizards for alligators, being commanded to stop to pay respect for the king twice a day, listening to the national orchestra in Lumphini park, or getting lost in the enormous Chatuchak market, there was never a dull moment.

We stayed in the old city and to complement the 4G coverage, there's also WiFi in every guesthouse and hostel we came across. We kicked off each morning with a mixed fruit ice smoothie from a street vendor, offering pretty much any fruit you can imagine.

We took a sleeper heading south, before transferring onto a bus and finally a ferry to get ourselves out to Ko Samui. Where we spent a week eating seafood, exploring the coastline by sea kayak and catching ferries out to explore the islands of the Ang Thong archipelago. Then we spent a few days on Ko Pha Ngan, staying in a wooden hut on the beach, spending our days snorkelling and swimming around the nearest island.

Eventually, we left the islands and travelled back to Bangkok by sleeper train, then took the 11 hour train and spent an entire day travelling north to Chiang Mai. The north of the country is cheaper and the people are friendlier here, but you'll notice the distinct lack of buzz that was present in Bangkok.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time in the North, everything from the jazz bars and gate markets in Chiang Mai to paddling bamboo rafts alongside enormous cave fish just below the surface in Tham Lod. The air was cooler to and the slight respite in temperature meant that covering distance  on foot was viable again and we took that opportunity to climb to some of the temples, hidden in the forests on the hills around us.

Eventually our month was up and we made the long journey back to Bangkok. My girlfriend hopped on a plane and made her way back to the UK, and I made the short flight over the border into Cambodia. Oh and due to an unfortunate series of events, my bank decided to cancel my card and re-issue a new one to my home address in the UK.

## Cambodia
Cambodia is a fascinating country. There's no public transport. The local currency is so weak that it's used exclusively as pocket change, with USD as the primary exchange rate. The official advice is not to leave defined paths, due to the number of undiscovered and unexploded landmines scattered across the country. Corruption? Check. Bribery? Check. It's not difficult to paint Cambodia in a harsh light, but doing so is a huge disservice to the most exciting country I've ever visited.

I landed in Siem Reap, the tourist capital of Cambodia. The local attraction of the temples of Angkor keep it as the most common stop for travellers crossing South-East Asia. Whether it was battling the sea of camera wielding tourists at Angkor Wat or just generally finding what seemed like an interesting city in "tourist mode", I was happy to move on after a few days in Siem Reap.

The network of temples that make up Angkor as a city are fascinating and the further you get from Angkor Wat, the further they have fallen into disrepair and been reclaimed by the jungle. Travelling around the site required the tuktuk and driver I hired as the original city of Angkor is said to have been the size of modern day Paris. It would have taken hours to have walked the distances between the temples I visited.

Travelling onwards was an interesting challenge. The few roads that connect the larger towns and cities are more like tracks without lighting and there's no concept of a speed limit. The frequency of accidents and the scams around stealing bags from sleeping passengers are abundant enough that the unofficial travelling advice there is not to travel at night. So I hopped on the first bus out of the city the next morning and made the seven hour journey to the capital of Phnom Penh.

I spent some time in a river town, before travelling to the south coast. A confused exchange with the driver of the van I was in meant I missed the village I was aiming for by a few miles and ending up in a fishing shanty town. Nothing that some broken French and 10 minutes on the back of a moped couldn't fix. Eventually I found a place to stay and spent the next few days eating fresh crab and exploring the near-deserted islands by longtail. It seemed like the tradition was for families and friends to sit out in the sun to eat dinner and drink beer together and I couldn't go down a single road without some inviting me to share with them. Honestly? I think I could have stayed there forever.

Eventually I found my way back to Phnom Penh. It's difficult to talk about Cambodia without mentioning the clouds hanging over the countries terrifyingly recent history and the brutality that happened there within living memory of half the population. There's no way to truly relate to what it must be like for a country to lose a quarter of the entire population to forced labour camps and executions, but a visit to the mass graves outside Phnom Penh are enough to give you a taste. These mass graves are not fields of neatly lined up headstones. These are marked off pits, sometimes containing two hundred mothers and their children, who were executed and thrown into the same hole. In all honesty, I'm glad I decided to go, but my visit there is not something I want to talk about.

Someone died on the floor above me that night, drank too much and choked. Someone had to deal with that. Drugs are abundant and so are police sting operations that almost always end with you paying an extortionate bribe. Many hostel rooms have a notice that lets you know what will happen if you bring back underage "guests". It's a constant reminder that unlike Thailand, Cambodia is not a country that will hold your hand whilst you explore.

My path eventually wound all the way back to Siem Reap. From there I flew to China, then Amsterdam and finally back to the UK. The core of the team is back together now and we're just about to start work on our next contract.

There's always room for more individuals with a sense of adventure at Astral Dynamics. We're a small company in an obscure part of the world, but we know we're doing some things right when it comes to our culture around work and life. Not every season is as exciting as this one was, but there's never a dull week either. If you're an exceptional designer or developer and would like to join our adventure, then [drop us a line](/contact) because we'd love to hear from you.
