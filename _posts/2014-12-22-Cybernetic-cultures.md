The Cybernetic Revolution is under way.
In the 1930s and 40s, back when computers were a relatively new idea, the 
field of Cybernetics emerged; looking at the complex information ecosystems 
of feedback loops. These systems exist in natural ecosystems, but
could for the first time be considered in artificial systems.
The physical reality of computers at the time meant that nothing dramatic was 
likely to happen any time soon, but the possibilities, for what you could in 
theory do with a connected Turing machine, lit up the minds of the technology 
visionaries, futurologists and science fiction writers who foresaw the 
dawning of a new age.
Mention Cybernetics and many people immediately think Cyborg, the Cybernetic 
Organism. Part man, part machine, the Cyborg is all too readily associated 
with dystopian futures in which men are controlled not by 
mass media manipulation, but by direct physical implants into 
their brains. 

Maybe it's not a bad thing that many of us feel a distinct aversion to the 
idea of getting ‘chipped’, even if futurologists fully expect we'll all 
be doing it within our lifetimes. However If you were hoping to avoid becoming 
a Cyborg
, then I have some bad news, the  chances are you already are one. The good 
news is that being a Cybernetic Organism isn't as bad as you might 
think. The dystopian man directly controlled by an all powerful dark lord, is 
really more of a drone legion, a far lesser creature than the 
cybernetically enabled modern human. 

Perhaps you're reading this on a smartphone whilst travelling on a train, or 
sitting on a park bench. In which case you need to accept that in 2014 you 
already are a Cyborg. Chips implanted in your brain are not required. The 
inherent neuroplasticity of your brain means that over the last few years it'
s been slowly adapting itself, even as the technology corporations have been 
adapting their devices so they integrate ever seamlessly into your being. You 
may remember some of the early smartphone had horrible resistive screens and 
were hard to use, but your finger is also much more effective now at 
communicating your mind to the machine with swipes and taps. 
Having adapted so that you can now interoperate effectively with this device, 
you are now officially the human half of a Cyborg. With your smartphone in 
hand you are now an organism that can interact with complex artificial 
information ecosystems. Tweets, posts, emails, we're constantly interacting 
in rich information ecosystems. Yes, there are forces that are working hard 
to manipulate us into buying products we don't really need, but as social 
creatures there's no doubt a Cybernetically enabled human is much more 
powerful that an ordinary human. We can easily share much more information 
with many more people than we ever could before. The internet was a very 
important step in human social evolution, but it is the smartphone and not 
chips in our brains that is the key step to us becoming Cybernetic Organisms. 

Does this mean that we will lose our humanity if this continues and become 
like machines?
Not necessarily. The human brain can only handle so much complexity. If we 
accept that we are already Cyborgs. Rather than dehumanise us, we can build 
applications that enable us to remain human in a world of ever increasing 
information complexity, no chips required. The smartphone has opens up the 
possibility of creating the complex cybernetic working cultures that are 
about to revolutionise our information bureaucracies in a very positive way. 

Although it's probably good for us to switch them off and get away from it 
all once in a while and practice being a basic human, to be effective in this 
ever complicated world we need to accept our digital extensions of ourselves. 
The closer we can be to the machine, the more effective we can be together as 
a Cybernetic Organism. 

As a society we're not yet ready for brain-chips, even if the technology were 
ready. However, there is so much we can do to revolutionise 
the way we work using natural Human Computer Interfaces, we’re a long long 
way reaching the limits of what can be done with just a modern smartphone. 
The human visual system is able to absorb information at a fantastic rate, 
increasingly Cognitive Science is helping us understand the way this works 
and as it does so we’re better able to design software interfaces that 
connect us to our information partners naturally and effectively. The key 
here is the information interface, it's really all about the Interface.

Traditional desktop systems have been designed as pure Computer Information 
Systems, the human operator scarcely considered in the design. In systems with 
complex information needs like the healthcare environment, the information 
and computation systems have been considered, but not the cognitive reality 
of the human users that are the most essential component of the system. 
Traditionally the software developer’s logic has been to consider what can be 
captured from the users and to create a standard form in order to capture the 
information. The vital importance of the interface in bridging man and 
machine isn’t given the attention it deserves.

For complex information systems to work effectively, we need human centred 
interface design. The machine communicates digital information through it's 
hardware. It really doesn't care what physical manifestation the information 
takes. We do! Our brains are already loaded with countless streams of complex 
information, having to force our human way of thinking and communicating 
through an interface that was designed for the ease of the information 
systems (and not for us as humans) is a huge cognitive load that we can't 
afford. 

The solution is to design complex information ecosystems that let us work 
far more effectively. Human Centred Interface design and natural intuitive 
mobile applications are essential. It's not only the interface between a 
single human and device that's important, it's essential to consider how 
individuals work together and how information is Integrated across 
systems.

Also, human working cultures are Complex Adaptive Systems. They cannot be forced 
into desired solutions. Instead, Systems need to be designed to attract 
working cultures to the sweet spots of operational efficiency, through 
constant monitoring and the application of feedback.

Let humans be humans and machines be machines, and 
together we'll make IT systems that work for humans, and not the other way 
around. We are destined to be Cybernetic Organisms but a utopian, and not a 
dystopian future is possible, though a lot of great work needs to be done 
in the coming decade to achieve it.
