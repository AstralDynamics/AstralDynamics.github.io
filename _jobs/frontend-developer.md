---

We're always looking for more enthusiastic frontend developers. You'll work in a high velocity team of programmers responsible for creating effective user interfaces for the web. 

Mostly we use Javascript with Babel to write ES6/ES7 code along with a simple NPM based toolchain, but recently we've been experimenting with ClojureScript and Reagent too. We use React in almost all of our projects, but writing Javascript without a framework shouldn't be a scary idea for you either.

## Required
* Good understanding of Javascript
* Experience with Node based tools
* Experience designing interfaces
* A sense of adventure

## Bonus
* Experience with React
* Experience with unit testing
* Experience with a transpile-to-js language
