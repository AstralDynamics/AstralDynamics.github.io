  A bespoke clocking in, time management and rotaring web-application. 
---

We have designed a bespoke web application for a local 3rd sector organisation. The application replaces a large amount of laborious paper work with a simple easy to use application that runs on tablet in fixed location and on users devices. This app is designed to provide higher quality data to managers and saves a huge amount of data entry by intergrating into the payroll system.
