  When you think software development headquarters, a converted chapel
  on the edge of Snowdonia is probably not what comes to mind. We've
  shaped and crafted our workspace to be as individual as the people
  working there.

Nestled in the hills of Snowdonia, at the foot of mount Elidir, can 
be found a beautiful Welsh Chapel. Here in this ancient Brythonic 
land which so inspired J.R. Tolkien tolkien, the Astral team works 
and weaves our deep magic of technology, innovation, culture and 
creativity. 

The concept we're developing is an Astral Ship. A vehicle on which
our multi-disciplinary team set's sail on voyages of innovation. The
ship is admittedly very much a proto-type but it is a powerful concept
which defines us as a company. Whether we're sailing around the clock
against tight deadlines or ashore exploring distant lands.

_The vessel in it's earliest iteration_

The most important feature of the Astral Ship is that it's a space
with a deep history in a beautiful setting which both inspires and 
facilitates creativity, collaboration, innovation and focussed technical development.
This is about all we want to say right now, but as the Astral adventure
continues we'll reveal more on this story. Stay tuned, or drop us a 
line if you resonate with this concept and want to get involved.
