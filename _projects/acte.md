  We worked with the Association of Corporate Travel Executives to create a visualisation tool for analysis of their conference data.
---

The Association of Corporate Travel Executives holds a number of regional conferences each year and a few global conference. They were aware that they had very little understanding of what drove membership and attendance at their larger conferences. In response Astral Dynamics created an interactive visual analytics tool which presents a number of visualisations of ACTEâ€™s data and allows the organisation to explore their data to find answers about the return on investment on their marketing activities.
