  We've spent the last two years working with the NHS in Wales,
  to develop a smartphone based platform designed to save healthcare
  professionals time, whilst improving patient safety, collaboration, 
  and reducing the cognitive load on already over burdened staff.

In 2014 we entered a Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) competition with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB), the challenge set was to save nurses 10% of time so that they could spent 10% more time at the bedside with Patients. Astral Dynamics got to work, Liam had worked in Secondary Health IT in Tokyo in the early 2000s but other than this we we're coming at this challenge completely fresh. We quickly got a picture of some of the pain points facing staff on the front line, battling with every increasing documentation pressures and workloads. Healthcare IT systems are generally windows desktops running XP with clunky interfaces and certainly not mobile. AD proposed an HTML5 cross platform mobile application based on our concept of Cybernetic working. The interface would be designed with the user's experience firmly in mind. Healthcare staff would be able to efficiently access digital information wherever they are, coordinate tasks, communicate and collaborate efficiently to deliver patient care.

AD’s idea was one of 5 to go forward to a feasibility study. For 4 months the team voyaged hard, following design thinking we immersed ourselves in learning about the secondary care environment. Listening to and observing staff at work and then back at the chapel, breaking out to creative brainstorming sessions. We we're successful and in November 2014 awarded an additional £400,000 to run a pilot. Astral Dynamics used this funding to pull together a dedicated team to work on and deliver the product and manage the pilot. In September 2015 a new spinout entity Elidir Health Ltd was created and officially took over deliver of the pilot, leaving the founding Astral Dynamics team free to continue exploring new Innovation on this and other projects.  

So far the pilot has been very well received and we're excited to see our vision being turned into reality. Elidir Health are carrying on the work with BCUHB in North Wales and continue to work at the cutting edge of what's possible with mobile application development. They're looking for talented frontend developers, if you're interested see [their website][1] for more details.
