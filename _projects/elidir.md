  We've spent the last two years working with the Welsh NHS, in order
  to develop a smartphone based platform designed to save Nurses as
  much as time as possible, whilst caring for patients.
---

In 2013 we entered an small business research initiative competition with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, tasked with envisaging a platform which would allow nurses to spend more time caring for patients, by eliminating communication mishaps and archaic paper processes.

We designed a platform focused on smartphones that would allow users to communicate, collaborate and contextualise data from their working environment. From an entry pool of 200 competitors, Astral Dynamics was selected as one of six to receive a period of initial funding, in order to build a working prototype of the system.

Three months later our prototype saw us go forward as one of two companies to receive the full funding for development and integration of the platform. In the year that followed we realised that this project was large and complex enough to need a full time team dedicated to making it happen. This resulted in our very first spin out company, in the form of [Elidir Health][1] (named after the mountain we watched through the office window on some of the longer days).

Elidir are carrying on the work with BCUHB in North Wales and continue to work on the cutting edge of what's possible with mobile application development. They're also looking for frontend developers, see [their website][1] for more details.
