We worked with a team at Bangor University to develop a digital enhancement for conventional museum tours, by allowing visitors to use their own smartphone to scan a QR code at each exhibit and record their own commentaries, or play back the commentaries that others left previously.

We also developed a exhibit management admin interface, which allowed museum staff to to play back and review the backlog of audio recordings.
