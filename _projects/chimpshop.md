  We worked with the psychology department at Bangor Univeristy to develop a 3D mobile game to help reduce attentional bias for addictive behaviour.

Working with the psychology department at Bangor University, Astral Dynamics produced a 3D mobile game, designed for use by alcoholics and those with other type of addictive behavioural health issues. The app works by training the players to reduce their attentional bias toward alcoholic stimuli by constantly shifting their attention towards more healthy alternative drinks.

The project was a successful translation of a laboratory experiment conducted at Bangor which demonstrated the Psychological principles into a fun, evidence based game which can actually help people with alcohol addiction.
