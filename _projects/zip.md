Astral Dynamics worked with Bangor University to develop a hybrid mobile app for assessing the development of social skills in young children. The app is still at the research stage and has been piloted with Children in Welsh schools and is used to capture responses to how they think they would act in a variety of social situations. The app is paired with an visualisation interface that presents the data to the researchers for further analysis and reporting.
